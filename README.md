# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow, this is not a complete project.

This is the exercise I am following: [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)

This is a ***[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)***  
But [this](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is a better Markdown Guide, from GitHub.

> This is a blockquote  
> What is this, then? (Same block)

> Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs.
>
> Like these, for example.
> 
> > Blockquotes can be nested.

---

**Code:** To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (``). `example`

```To create code blocks use three backticks to open and three backticks to close. Is this really I code block? I don't think so, but I'm not sure.```
