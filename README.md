# markdown-link-syntax
Markdown Link Syntax w/examples:

- Inline Links: [My GitHub profile](https://github.com/glossyibis)
- Autolinked URLs: www.github.com/glossyibis
- Section Links (Anchor Links): [Go back to the top](#hello-world)
- Reference-Style Links: Read the [official docs][docs-link]. Check out the [project website][project-web].
  <!-- Links definition section (usually at the bottom) -->
  [docs-link]: https://docs.github.com/
  [project-web]: https://example.com/project
  <!-- I have yet to improve my understanding of reference-style links. -->
- Links around images: _(It is not possible to force a link to open in a new tab using standard Markdown syntax in a GitHub Markdown file (like a README.md file rendered directly on the GitHub website.)_
